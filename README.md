Student. 22. México. Part-time Web Developer. My home is anywhere with terminal access. I love booting software on hardware where it's not intended to do so: First Hackintosh at 12, thinkering with the aosp kernel since 2012. To write is my passion and I do so a lot on my personal notebook, sometimes it even lands on my blog (in Spanish).    

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a freelancer.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer engineering.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on the open source software I already use. 
- 🤔 I don't even know why, but love the emoji.
- 💬 Ask me about macOS, *nix, bash, hackintoshes and the meaning of life itself (may or may not require a coffee).
- 📫 How to reach me: [@xtrs84zk](https://twitter.com/xtrs84zk)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: One time, I made a [weird utility](https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g/general/falcon-bootloader-upgrader-tool-t3093793) that got 30K downloads. Still can't explain what it does when asked.
